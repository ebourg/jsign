Jsign is a versatile code signing tool that allows you to sign and timestamp Windows
executable files, installer packages and scripts. Jsign is platform independent
and provides an alternative to native tools like signtool on Windows or the Mono
development tools on Unix systems. It's particularly well-suited for signing
executable wrappers and installers generated by tools such as NSIS, msitools,
install4j, exe4j or launch4j. It emphasizes on seamless integration with cloud key
management systems and hardware tokens.

Jsign is available as a command line tool for Linux, macOS and Windows, as a task/plugin
for various build systems (Maven, Gradle, Ant, GitHub Actions), and as a Java library.

Jsign is free to use and licensed under the [Apache License version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
