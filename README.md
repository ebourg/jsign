Jsign is a Java implementation of Microsoft Authenticode that lets you sign
and timestamp executable files for Windows, Microsoft Installers (MSI), Cabinet
files (CAB) and scripts. Jsign is platform independent and provides an
alternative to native tools like signcode/signtool on Windows or the Mono
development tools on Unix systems.

Jsign comes as an easy-to-use task/plugin for the main build systems (Maven,
Gradle, Ant). It's especially suitable for signing executable wrappers and
installers generated by tools like NSIS, msitools, install4j, exe4j or launch4j.
Jsign can also be used programmatically or standalone as a command line tool.

Jsign is free to use and licensed under the Apache License version 2.0.

## Features
* Platform independent signing of Windows executables, DLLs, Microsoft Installers (MSI), Cabinet files (CAB) and scripts (PowerShell, VBScript, JScript, WSF)
* Timestamping with retries and fallback on alternative servers (RFC 3161 and Authenticode protocols supported)
* Supports multiple signatures per file, for all file types
* Extracts and embeds detached signatures to support [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/embedded-signatures/)
* Hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512
* Keystores supported:
  * PKCS#12, JKS and JCEKS files
  * PKCS#11 hardware tokens ([YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com), [Nitrokey](https://www.nitrokey.com), etc)
  * Cloud key management systems ([Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/), [DigiCert ONE](https://one.digicert.com), [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management), [SSL.com eSigner](https://www.ssl.com/esigner/))
* Private key formats: PVK and PEM (PKCS#1 and PKCS#8), encrypted or not
* Certificates: PKCS#7 in PEM and DER format
* Build tools integration (Maven, Gradle, Ant)
* Command line signing tool
* Authenticode signing API ([Javadoc](https://ebourg.github.io/jsign/apidocs/))

## Changes

#### Version 4.1 (in development)

* The SSL.com eSigner service has been integrated

* The default timestamping authority is now Sectigo instead of Comodo

#### Version 4.0 (2021-08-09)

* MS Cabinet signing has been implemented (contributed by Joseph Lee)
* Signatures can be detached and re-attached to make the builds reproducible without access to the private key

* The Azure Key Vault, DigiCert ONE and Google Cloud KMS cloud key management systems have been integrated
* The Maven plugin can now sign multiple files by defining a fileset (contributed by Bernhard Stiftner).
* The command line tool can now sign multiple files
* The `alias` parameter is now optional if the keystore contains only one entry (contributed by Michele Locati)
* The keystore aliases are now listed in the error message if the alias specified is incorrect
* The `storetype` parameter is no longer required for JCEKS keystores
* Fixed the update of the PE checksum (contributed by Markus Kilås)
* The `CMSAlgorithmProtection` attribute is no longer added to the signature (contributed by Yegor Yarko)

* Upgraded BouncyCastle to 1.69

#### Version 3.1 (2020-03-01)

* The Maven plugin now accepts passwords encrypted using the Maven security settings (contributed by Denny Bayer)
* The Maven plugin is now bound by default to the `package` phase
* The timestamping is no longer enabled by default with the Maven plugin
* Renamed the command line tool from `pesign` to `jsign`
* Renamed the Ant task and the Gradle extension method from `signexe` to `jsign`

* Upgraded BouncyCastle to 1.64

#### Version 2.1 (2018-10-08)
