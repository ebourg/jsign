Jsign is a Java implementation of Microsoft Authenticode that lets you sign
and timestamp executable files for Windows, Microsoft Installers (MSI), Cabinet
files (CAB), Catalog files (CAT), Windows packages (APPX/MSIX), Microsoft
Dynamics 365 extension packages, NuGet packages and scripts. Jsign is platform
independent and provides an alternative to native tools like signcode/signtool
on Windows or the Mono development tools on Unix systems.

Jsign comes as an easy-to-use task/plugin for the main build systems (Maven, Gradle,
Ant, GitHub Actions). It's especially suitable for signing executable wrappers and
installers generated by tools like NSIS, msitools, install4j, exe4j or launch4j.
Jsign can also be used programmatically or standalone as a command line tool.

Jsign is free to use and licensed under the [Apache License version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
