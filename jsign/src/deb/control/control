Description: Code signing for Windows executables, Microsoft Installers and scripts
 Jsign is a versatile code signing tool that allows you to sign and timestamp
 Windows executable files, installer packages and scripts. Jsign is platform
 independent and provides an alternative to native tools like signtool on
 Windows or the Mono development tools on Unix systems. It's particularly
 well-suited for signing executable wrappers and installers generated by tools
 such as NSIS, msitools, install4j, exe4j or launch4j. It emphasizes on
 seamless integration with cloud key management systems and hardware tokens.
