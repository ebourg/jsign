TODO

- Verify signed files
- GUI
- Support private keys exported with PKCS#8 
- Detect the type of the keystore automatically (guess from the extension and try all the other types as a fallback)
- Support unauthenticated blobs
- Sign multiple files (fileset)
- Support generating MsiDigitalSignatureEx entries when signing MSI files (requires access to the streams metadata in POI)
- load password from the environment (CLI syntax: env:VARIABLE_NAME)
- AWS KMS integration
